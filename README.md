# Fireworks AI Chatbot API Integration

This Python script demonstrates how to integrate with the Fireworks AI Chatbot API to generate responses based on user input.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have:

- Python installed on your system
- An API key from Fireworks AI. You can obtain this by signing up for their service and creating an API key.

## Setup

1. Install the required Python packages using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

2. Replace `<API_KEY>` in the script with your actual Fireworks AI API key.

3. Ensure your input payload (`payload` dictionary) is configured according to your requirements. Adjust parameters such as `max_tokens`, `top_p`, `top_k`, `temperature`, etc., based on your desired chatbot behavior.

## Usage

1. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python chatbot.py
    ```

2. Upon execution, the script sends a POST request to the Fireworks AI API with the user input provided in the payload.

3. The API returns a response containing the chatbot's reply.

4. The script then extracts and prints the chatbot's response.

## Script Explanation

- `url`: The endpoint for the Fireworks AI Chatbot API.
- `payload`: Configuration parameters including the model to use, maximum tokens, presence penalty, etc. Adjust these parameters as needed.
- `headers`: HTTP headers including content type and authorization. Replace `<API_KEY>` with your actual API key.
- `response`: Sends a POST request to the API and captures the response.
- `llm_response`: Extracts the chatbot's response from the API response and prints it.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure you comply with Fireworks AI's terms of service and usage policies when using their API.
- This script provides a basic example of interacting with the Fireworks AI API. For more complex interactions or integrations, consult the Fireworks AI API documentation.
